## Flask + Vercel

This example shows how to use Flask 2 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://flask-python-template.vercel.app/

## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Diablo Immortal Warband Calculator

This simple web app will accept as input a csv file containing (strict format - if format not respected there may be errors when running or wrong results):

player,str,int,will,fort,vit,<br>
playername,0,0,0,0,0,<br>
playername,0,0,0,0,0,<br>

replace playername with player name. Keep adding to file. Order of players doesn't matter (mix and match)<br>
and     values (0s) with the corresponsing values. Leave 0 if no value
